    | Disclaimer: I am just a student, think with your Discretion . I am
    | just trying to put together things based on what I have learned till
    | now. Feel free to
    a(href='mailto:deshmukhabhishek369@gmail.com') mail
    |  if you wanna
    |             talk.
  p This post is not about teaching programming in school.
  p
    | Even if you are not a programmer or web-developer do not worry this
    | post has been written with you in mind as well.
  p
    | First some background about me, I am a physics student with an
    | interest in programming, web development, running, etc.. you know
    | all the good stuff. I am in my second year as I am writing this blog
    | post. I also do some freelancing, and not particularly happy with
    | the way education was done with me.
  h2 Test Driven Development
  p
    | Let me quickly go over what Test Driven Development(TDD) is all
    | about
  p
    a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development') Wikipedia
    |             says:
  .quote
    | Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that
    | relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:
    | requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code
    | is improved so that the tests pass.
  p
    | I know, it sounds jargon. Let me explain, it means that you decide
    | on the purpose of what your program is supposed to do, then you
    | write a script/program which checks if your program is doing what it
    | is supposed to.
  p
    | Note that this &quot;test/s&quot; is/are written before writing the actual
    | program. Now that the test has been written you go ahead and run the
    | test, and it
    a fails
    |  because you haven&apos;t written the program
    |             yet, then you write the program and run the test on it again, and
    |             keep on repeating till the tests
    span(style='color: green;') pass
    | .
  p
    | Now that your tests have passed you refactor the code write it in a
    | better manner, put in the styling, the finishing touch if you would
    | like to call it that.
  p
    | This gave rise to the famous phrase &quot;
    a red
    | -
    span(style='color: green;') green
    | -refactor&quot;.
  p
    | To someone who hasn&apos;t been doing this, I know this sounds lame and a
    | lot of work but when you do it once, you cannot stop doing it.
  p
    | Yeah, the last line has its importance which will be discussed
    | below.
  h2 Schools
  p
    | School is someplace where education is provided.
  p
    | Education is an important part of anybody&apos;s life. A formal level of
    | education is necessary for each and every individual.
  p
    | In case you are unfamiliar with what education is all about, here is
    | what
    a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education') Wikipedia
    |  has
    |             to say about it.
  .quote
    | Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
    | acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.
  p
    | So basically, it means, teaching people(primarily kids) how to do
    | things. I say primarily kids because education as an adult is not
    | considered necessary which needs a little more discussion if you ask
    | me(maybe another post).
  h2 TDD and schools
  p
    | When you look at the explanation for what education is it looks
    | eerily similar to what programming is about. Both can be generalized
    | as
  .quote
    | Enabling someone/something to do a particular thing/process.
  p
    | This begs one to ask the question if the techniques used to do one
    | can be used in the other one.
  p
    | Whether or not you(programmer/teacher) have been successful, in your
    | attempt of, enabling a person or computer to be able to do a certain
    | task, can be known via testing.
  p
    | That explains and radicalizes the tradition of tests in school.
    | Meaning you are checking whether or not, the student is capable of
    | doing the task/process it was taught, when asked to do it.
  p
    | The world seems to have already done that, whether or not the
    | testing &quot;philosophy&quot; was derived from programming, or if they have
    | another source is irrelevant, but none the less interesting.
  h2 Going a step further
  p
    | Now that we have taken in a method used in programming, we could ask
    | if we are doing the mistakes which programmers do in that method, in
    | teaching.
  p
    | After scavenging through the internet and via personal experiences I
    | was able to write a (more or less exhaustive) list of mistakes done
    | using TDD.
  ul
    li Architectural testing
    li Non-user accessible testing
    li Dependency-hell tests
  p
    | If you run into any new ones
    a(href='mailto:deshmukhabhishek369@gmail.com') let me know
    |  and
    |             I&apos;ll plug it in here, with credits of-course.
  p
    | Let&apos;s got through them one by one in detail.
  h3 Architectural testing
  p
    | This usually happens when a developer likes TDD too much, the
    | developer not only writes tests for the task completion, but also
    | for how the program/script is implementing it. This may sound
    | unimportant and might give a sense of strength to the tests. But it
    | removes one of the main advantages that come along with TDD.
  p
    | One of the main advantages of TDD is that you can change your code
    | and test if it still works. Meaning you can implement it using a
    | different/better method and check if that works without by just
    | running the tests and not rewriting them. But if your tests are
    | testing the method by which the task is done then you will have to
    | rewrite the tests which increase work.
  p
    | The user of the software (usually) does not care how it does the
    | provided task, writing tests for that only increases the difficulty
    | when you find out a better method to complete the task.
  p
    u What does this mean for testing in schools?
  p
    | This tells them to not love testing too much...
  p
    | On a serious note, this leads our attention to the question
    br
    |             &quot;what are tests in schools testing?&quot;
    br
    | Are they testing if the
    |             student is capable of doing the task, or are they making sure that
    |             the student is doing it using only the provided/decided method?
  p
    | The problem which Architectural testing causes are re-writing the
    | tests when new/better methods are found. That is an issue when
    | programming, But in school, the test/question papers are written
    | every year anyway, so one might assert that this is a pure
    | programming issue, and architectural testing is fine in school
    | tests.
  p
    | But this discussion brings our attention to the question as to,
    br
    | whether we want our kids to be not given the freedom to do the
    |             task in question by any method they know?
  p
    | If you give it enough though that last question is a rather tricky
    | one. Mainly because it is difficult to generalize a statement for
    | all situations, so let me try to be a little exhaustive about the
    | answer.
  .quote
    | Tests in schools should not check, by what method the asked task was
    | performed, and should only check if the output is what has been
    | expected. Unless the students have been taught a new and &quot;better&quot;
    | method to do the task and that is what the test is about.
  p
    br
    br
    |             I was not able to find the translations of the other 2 testing
    |             mistakes into the education space.
  h2 Ending remarks
  p
    | TDD seems like a good method which formalizes education in schools
    | to keep things in check.
  p
    | It only teaches students to do a task and positively re-inforces
    | teachers to teach students to do tasks and not how to think by
    | themselves and do the task. We are creating people who will be able
    | to do pre-defined things, but we are not teaching them how to come
    | up with things to do.

    |By onpage SEO I mean the meta tags on the top of the page, as you might
    | know vue/react/angular all load the html after the page has opened in a
    | browser and javascript is run, but not all webcrawlers all adept enough
    | to do this and rank your correctly.
  p
    | To over come this problem, the "popular" opinion you will hear on the
    | internet is prerendering your page, meaning you run a part of the
    | javascript in the build time to have considerable amount of html
    | already loaded, which works. This can be done with Vue-press or Nuxt
    | and if you are a react fan then with Gatsby. But lets say for whatever
    | reason you cannot do that, maybe you don't have time to learn, maybe the
    | deadline is too close and this is first time you learnt about SEO.
  p
    |Whatever the reason maybe if you have a vue app ready with vuex then,
    | This is a set of dirty tricks which can get your SEO game up.

    | Yeah, yeah, I know you don't have time to learn Vue-press or Nuxt, turns
    | out you can kinda do that without them, yes I mean manually.
  p
    |Make a file called
    |
    span.code meta.txt
    |
    | besides your
    |
    span.code package.json
  p
    |In that file put in all the meta tags and stuff that you want in the head,
    | of the html.
  p
    |Minify it with
    |
    |
    a(href="https://www.willpeavy.com/tools/minifier/", target="_blank") this
    |.
  p
    |Now, every time you do a build, just copy the content of this file and
    |paste it in the head of
    |
    span.code index.html
    |
    |inside the
    |
    span.code dist/
    |
    |directory.
  p
    | The link preview will start looking beautiful after this.

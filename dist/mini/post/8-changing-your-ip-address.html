It's an identifying number for network hardware connected to a network. Having an IP address allows other in the same IP network to communicate with one another</p><p>Most ip address look like this</p><div class=code>192.168.1.1</div><p>this is an ipv4 address, there are other kinds of software like ipv6 which looks something like this</p><div class=code>4324.2465.3423::3424</div><h2>What is my current IP address?</h2><p>Just google <span class=code>my ip</span></p><h2>Why would you wanna change yours?</h2><p>It's usually to access things that your current IP address is not allowed to, for valid or invalid reasons. (I mean who is to judge?)</p><h2>How do I change it?</h2><p>Here are 3 ways</p><h3>Phone data</h3><p>If you are connected to your wifi, turn on your phone's hotspot and if your phone's ip address isn't blocked then your ip address will be the one unders your phone's network, essentially allowing you to access what you wanted to.</p><h3>VPN</h3><p>Just in case the last one did not work due to some reason, you can always connect to a vpn, there are a lot of great free and paid vpn sources, and if you don't like any of those you can always set up your own vpn for a rather cheap price (I provide that as a service, <a href=mailto:deshmukhabhishek369@gmail.com target=_blank>contact me</a> if you want a ready made private and secure vpn)</p><h3>Traditional</h3><p>the traditional way to do it.</p><h4>Windows</h4><ol><li>Open Control Panel and then select <span class=code>Network and Sharing Center</span></li><li>On the left side select <span class=code>Change adapter setting</span></li><li>This will list all the connections available, double click the connect which provides Most probably your wifi, or ethernet.

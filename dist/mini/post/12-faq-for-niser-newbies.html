Most of the things here will apply nearly across Universities, but I wouldn't bet on it.</p><h2>Where is the shopping complex?</h2><p>Google it.</p><p>Yes the campus is really huge (you'll get used to it). Google maps has it.</p><h2>How do I operate the washing machine?</h2><p>Look for it on youtube or contact the nearest senior (you will be surprised to see how helpfull they actually are).</p><h2>How does the canteen system in NISER work?</h2><p>The canteen system in NISER is very similar to a restaurant's. You look through the menu for things you wanna eat, you pay at the counter get a for a coupon, then go the other counter, exchange coupon for food.</p><p>I might have skipped some steps but you will get them we you see it.</p><p>As you might have already guessed we don't have a monthly mess system, grow up.</p><h2>Which hostel to prefer for breakfast, lunch,snacks and dinner?</h2><p>It depends on personal preference, all the 4 canteens (not sure if all are under operation right now) cater to different tastes. You can see their menus at <a target=_blank href=https://www.niser.ac.in/~smishra/canteen-menu/ >https://www.niser.ac.in/~smishra/canteen-menu/</a> It is updated everyday so check it out before going for a meal.</p><h2>Whether to participate in extra curricular activities or not?</h2><p>Obviously, 1st year will be the most preferable batch to do all these. You haven't selected any specific subject as major, so don't worry about that. After all, from 2nd year onwards you have to be responsible towards your juniors. So why not experience all these in 1st year itself!</p><h2>How is life at NISER?</h2><p>Never ask about life at NISER to anyone just experience it yourself if you feel you are in right direction continue, if not then no need to suffer just choose whatever you really wanna do.</p><h2>What are the clubs at NISER?</h2><p>There's a considerable number of clubs in NISER, everything from, photography to basketball to literature to science (of course!!).</p><p>You will be approached by clubs once the club member's are back on campus, if you wanna the list of clubs, there is gonna be a student Affair's website soon, which will contain the information about all the clubs and contact information as well (keep checking this page).</p><h2>What are the on-campus facilities?</h2><p>From what I can tell you should already know about these, but here they are (not sure about exhaustiveness)</p><ul><li>Health Centre</li><li>Pharmacy (which provides on prescription from health Centre)</li><li>Grocery/convenience store, shopping complex</li><li>Main Library</li><li>Department libraries (you don't have access to these till you join one)</li><li>Computer center (There's enough machines for everyone)</li><li>Gym (We got an upgrade last year, it has some good stuff)</li><li>Meditation Center (MC, hill top)</li></ul><p></p><h2>Can my parent's temporarily stay on campus if they want to?</h2><p>Currently the Guest house facilities are closed due to the pandemic situation, but soon enough when things clear up (hopefully) the facilities will be resumed.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, the guest houses need to be booked, at least one week prior to accommodation, they charge relatively acceptably.</p><h2>What are the professors like?</h2><p>Depends on who you ask. All the professors are EXTREMELY (I cannot emphasis this enough) well versed in their own research fields and are excellent scientists (This does not mean you do not question what they say, it means you can question them without being afraid of getting scolded). As professors, you may find some extremely delightful and some not so. If this question is asked on the basis of rumors in sites like Quora, I'd suggest you ignore rumors spread by anonymous people and judge from your own experience. :)</p><h2>Who do I contact in case of any emergency which might require help of college authority?</h2><p>In case you have an emergency which can only be solved by some college authority, the first person to contact is the Dean of Student Affairs (DoSA). Presently (2020) the DoSA is Dr. Renjith Mathew. The best way to contact is by mailing (best done after you've received your NISER mail id). But remember that he is also a busy person, so do not contact him unless necessary.</p><h2>How do I get a professor's email id?</h2><p>Look for them on the NISER website or just google them (I was surprized by this too).</p><h2>Ragging....?</h2><p>We don't allow ragging in or outside the campus. All the seniors are extremely helpful and different people are good at different things. We have also received a lot of help from our own seniors, and to be honest, they feel more like family. However, we have an Anti-Ragging Squad (check NISER website) for any matters related to ragging (if any).</p><h2>How will studying at NISER help in future?</h2><ol><li>Better understanding of concepts and preliminary ideas of conducting any research</li><li>It adds extra bonus to selection in any competitive exams like UPSC</li><li>Adds Chances of getting Ph.D outside india</li></ol><h2>Some "Suggestions" from your seniors.</h2><note><these>were anonymously sent by NISER students.</these></note><ul><li>Use SciHub, LibGen, GitHub - best decisions</li><li>Feel free to hit up any senior you know if you have any problems</li><li>1. Don't pee in the pool (there is no pool). 2. If you pee in the pool, your toilet privileges will be revoked (friend's suggestion, not mine). 3. Fun Tasks - a)Find where the aquatic complex is. b)Sing the aquatic complex. 4. Shid, fard, poo even 7. Eighty eight hh</li><li>College life is fun but also challenging in other ways. Don't lose sight of who you are and what you want to be in life. Put in your best effort, but not at the cost of your health and well-being. Enjoy yourself and take every opportunity to grow that you can.</li><li>Every department is the best for youniff you have interest for that subject. The "so-called" best dept you will hear from most, would be harsh for you if you don't have interest in that subject.</li><li>There are endless things to do and explore at NISER but your studies and your attendance should be the first priority after that you can do whatever you wanna do. From photography to cricket, from singing to robotics, from gym to hanging out everything..............</li><li>Best place in whole NISER , without any doubt, is Meditation Center (aka MC) . It's the place on the hill (actually I didn't know it was called MC).</li><li>When you join NISER, profs knows that a bunch of students are weak in maths or say any subject and they do teach from the base. all you have to do is try to study what is taught on the same day and ask for help. Asking for help is important. You may ask batchmates, profs, TAs, or even seniors. every individual in cg is always welcoming and feels good about helping others.</li><li>Remember that we are a small community of people and we are like a close family. The seniors here are helpful and one doesn't need to fear ragging.</li><li>Finish everything as it comes. Don't pile stuff up</li><li>I want to tell them that ITS NOT COMPULSORY TO DO AN INTERNSHIP IN THE FIRST YEAR, infact it's a waste of time. Tell them about libgen(ahem ahem). There are pretty cool facilities in niser that people don't use to the full extent like the robotics lab, physics' sac room, funds that we can can get to perform our own experiments, etc. But MOST IMPORTANTLY student offers for niser (and all students in general)- autodesk 3yr license, GitHub pro and associated offers, flight discounts, prime discount, etc.</li><li>I NEED SUGGESTIONs TOO ðŸ™‚</li></ul></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-3 col-lg-3"><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cookie" rel=stylesheet async><a class=bmc-button target=_blank href=https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dunce07><img src=https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/bmc-new-btn-logo.svg alt="Buy me a coffee" async><span style=margin-left:5px;font-size:28px!important>Buy me a coffee</span></a></div></div></div><script src=../js/latex.js></script><script src=../js/github-cards.js async></script><script src=../js/main.js></script><footer>Made with love by <a href=https://abhishek-deshmukh.ml target=_blank>Abhishek Anil Deshmukh</a></footer></body></html>

            I recently rented a new server from OVH cloud, they are super cheap
            check them out.
          </p>
          <p>NO, they do not sponsor me.</p>
          <p>
            Getting your hand into nginx without any prior knowledge about
            servers and reverse proxies and all those fancy terms, can be
            difficult
          </p>
          <p>
            Although it is important that to learn all of them, sometimes you
            just want it working and quickly.
          </p>
          <h2>Reverse proxy</h2>
          <p>First lets get the concept out of the way.</p>
          <p>
            Reverse proxy server is used to hide all the mess the developer has
            made behind a single ip.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lets start with a normal server, you take a domain name like
            &quot;www.example.com&quot; and point it to an ip, hopefully the ip of your
            server and whenever someone searches your domain name in a browser
            or by any other way that goes to the port 80 or 443 of your server
            based on http or https.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things start to get out of hand when you use server name, like
            &quot;other.example.com&quot; and &quot;somethingelse.example.com&quot; or
            &quot;whatever.example.com&quot;. these nameservers come when you rent the
            domainname, and you can aim them to other servers or the same
            server.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are anything like me you don&apos;t want to buy different servers
            for each and every project or nameserver. what you can do instead is
            serve your content on different ports on the same server and tell
            nginx to to set nameservers to ports on localhost of that machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            and to set these thing up you need to ssh into the server and edit
            the unreadable nginx config. thats is why i made nrps, after setting
            up nrps you get a front-end webapp on which you can view or edit the
            nginx config with easy input menues and stuff.
          </p>

              <p>
                You should be on an unix based system, meaning a mac or some
                distribution of linux.
              </p>
              <p>windows does not work yet.</p>
              <p>You can find out how to install these on the internet.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://nodejs.org" style="color: red;">node.js</a></li>
                <li>SSH</li>
                <li>any text editor</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Setting up NRPS</h2>
              <p>
                There are two parts to it the backend(flask) and the frontend(vue).
                because of all the passwords and lack of developers still to deal
                with them, you have to go in and put in a few things by hand, but
                don't worry i will share each and every step here so hang tight.
              </p>
              <p>
                First lets get all the file we need on a local machine. there are 2
                ways to do this. if you have git installed(which you should) just do<br><span class="code">
                  git clone
                  https://github.com/abhishek-deshmukh/nrps/tree/v0.3.0</span><br>            or if you don&apos;t have git, then you can download it form
                <a href="https://github.com/abhishek-deshmukh/nrps/tree/v0.3.0">here</a>
              </p>
              <p>You will have a directory structure like this:</p>
              <div class="code dir">.<br>            &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; backend<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; api.py<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; main.conf<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; requirements.txt<br>            &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; dir.txt<br>            &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; frontend<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; babel.config.js<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; package.json<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; package-lock.json<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; public<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; favicon.ico<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; index.html<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; readme.md<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; src<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; app.vue<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; assets<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; logo.png<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; components<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; helloworld.vue<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; login.vue<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; proxy.vue<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; main.ts<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; plugins<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; bootstrap-vue.js<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; router<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; index.ts<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; shims-tsx.d.ts<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; shims-vue.d.ts<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; store<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; index.ts<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; views<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; about.vue<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; home.vue<br>            &boxv;&nbsp;&nbsp; &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; tsconfig.json<br>            &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; readme.md<br></div>
              <p>
                Yes, it might look overwhelming but don&apos;t worry you only have do a
                few things to get this working.
              </p>
              <p>Now open the file<span class="code">backend/api.py</span> in your favourite
                 text-editor(vim). on lines 11 and 12 enter username and password
                 inside the quotes like so.
              </p>
              <div class="code dir">10|# enter things here<br> 11|username = &quot;dunce&quot;<br> 12|password = &quot;somethinglonganddifficult&quot;<br> 13|# enter things here<br></div>
              <p>okay now the backend should has all the things inside it ready.</p>
              <p>
                lets set up a few things inside the frontend now shall we? open the
                file
                <span class="code">frontend/src/store/index.ts</span>
                again in your favorite text editor(vim) and look for
                <span class="code">rootURL</span>
                and put in the domain name of your remote server in quotes provided and then
                just below that put in a name for the
                <span class="code">server</span>
                in quotes
              </p>
              <p>now go to the base directory, and run</p>
              <div class="code">$ ./build.sh</div>
              <p>
                If you get a security issue, run
                <span class="code">chown +x build.sh</span>
                 and then try again.
              </p>
              <p>
                The setup is complete, and in the build files are in the folder
                called build, if you know how to move them to the server do that and
                skip this part, and if you don&apos;t then read along, now lets move
                these things to your server.
              </p>
              <h2>Moving to the SERVER</h2>
              <p>
                Assuming you are a user on the server and you have the password for
                the user, we can &grave;scp&grave; the files into the server, &grave;scp&grave; is used to
                send files over ssh.
              </p>
              <p>Now go to the base directory and run</p>
              <div class="code">$ scp -r build/ user@ipaddress:~</div>
              <p>
                in the above command replace
                <span class="code">user</span>
                 with your username on the server and the
                <span class="code">ipaddress</span>
                 with the ipaddress of your server.
              </p>
              <p>
                when you run it will prompt you for the password of the user on the
                remote server, i would recommend giving it that.
              </p>
              <p>
                now that the build files have been moved to the server lets deploy
                it on the server on part at a time
              </p>
              <p>now to connect to the server we will use ssh</p>
              <div class="code">$ ssh user@ipaddress</div>
              <p>
                after which it will ask for the password of the user on the server,
                i would recommend you give it that.
              </p>
              <h2>pre-requisites part 2</h2>
              <p>These are things to be installed on the server.</p>
              <p>
                Most servers run UBUNTU so, here is the installation command for
                ubuntu, if you are not on ubuntu don't worry all these packages
                should be in the package managers of your distribution.
              </p>
              <div class="code">
                $ sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade &amp;&amp; sudo apt install nginx
                supervisor python3 python3-pip software-properties-common &amp;&amp; pip3
                install virtualenv python3-certbot-nginx &amp;&amp; sudo apt-add-repository universe
                &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
              </div>
              <p>these were installed on the server:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>python3</li>
                <li>python3-pip</li>
                <li>virtualenv</li>
                <li>certbot</li>
                <li>python3-certbot-nginx</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                once these things are installed lets move on to deploying the
                backend.
              </p>
              <h2>Deploying</h2>
              <p>Lets begin by getting sudo access</p>
              <div class="code">$ sudo su</div>
              <p>
                This will prompt you for a password of the user on the server, put
                that in and your prompt should change to something like:<span class="code">root@something #</span>
              </p>
              <p>now go into the build/ folder and run</p>
              <div class="code"># ./install.sh example.com ipaddress</div>
              <p>
                Replace ip-address with the ip of your remote server and example.com
                with domain name you want nrps hosted at.
              </p>
              <p>If you run into any permission issues run:</p>
              <div class="code"># chmod +x install.sh</div>
              <p>the deployment is complete.</p>
              <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
              <h4>How to install node and npm?</h4>
              <p>you can visit<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">nodejs.org</a> for details
                            on how to do that.
              </p>
              <h4>Not abel to login in at the webpage, what to do?</h4>
              <p>
                there are a lot of possible things that could have gone wrong but
                usually it is the firewall just run:
              </p>
              <div class="code">$ sudo ufw allow 8081/http</div>
              <p>and everything should be working.</p>
              <h4>Can I use the reverse proxy for other servers as well?</h4>
              <p>
                yes, if the other server has https instead of http in its url, then
                put http in place of location, the browser will switch to https on
                its own.
              </p>
              <h4>How to change NRPS username and password?</h4>
              <p>edit the username and password in<span class="code">/etc/nginx/nrps/api.py</span> and then you will
                            have to restart supervisorctl for the new code to take action, to do
                            that the run:
              </p>
              <div class="code">$ sudo supervisorctl restart nginx:nrps</div>

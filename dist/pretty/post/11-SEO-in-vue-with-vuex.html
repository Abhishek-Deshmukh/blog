          <h2>SEO</h2>
          <p>
            By onpage SEO I mean the meta tags on the top of the page, as you might
            know vue/react/angular all load the html after the page has opened in a
            browser and javascript is run, but not all webcrawlers all adept enough
            to do this and rank your correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            To over come this problem, the "popular" opinion you will hear on the
            internet is prerendering your page, meaning you run a part of the
            javascript in the build time to have considerable amount of html
            already loaded, which works. This can be done with Vue-press or Nuxt
            and if you are a react fan then with Gatsby. But lets say for whatever
            reason you cannot do that, maybe you don't have time to learn, maybe the
            deadline is too close and this is first time you learnt about SEO.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever the reason maybe if you have a vue app ready with vuex then,
            This is a set of dirty tricks which can get your SEO game up.
          </p>
          <h2>Pre-rendering (Not what you think)</h2>
          <p>
            Yeah, yeah, I know you don't have time to learn Vue-press or Nuxt, turns
            out you can kinda do that without them, yes I mean manually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make a file called
            <span class="code">meta.txt</span>
            besides your
            <span class="code">package.json</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            In that file put in all the meta tags and stuff that you want in the head,
            of the html.
          </p>
          <p>
            Minify it with
            
            <a href="https://www.willpeavy.com/tools/minifier/" target="_blank">this</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, every time you do a build, just copy the content of this file and
            paste it in the head of
            <span class="code">index.html</span>
            inside the
            <span class="code">dist/</span>
            directory.
          </p>
          <p>
            The link preview will start looking beautiful after this.
